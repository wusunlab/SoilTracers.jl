# soiltracers

A model to simulate soil–atmosphere exchange of trace gases.

**Warning: under construction! Features not complete!**

This ~~is~~ will be an ~~Julia~~ OCaml implementation of [Sun et al.
(2015)](https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-8-3055-2015) and [Ogée et al.
(2016)](https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-13-2221-2016) models of soil carbonyl
sulfide (COS) exchange. The current plan is to have CO<sub>2</sub> and COS as
tracers. More tracers will be planned in the future work (e.g., CH<sub>4</sub>,
N<sub>2</sub>O, etc.).
